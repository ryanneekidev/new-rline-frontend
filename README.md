RLine is a project to practice building full stack applications end to end.

It currently serves as a small and barebones social media application that allows users to create accounts with their email address, post text messages which are visible to other users who can interact with them by liking them and posting comments under them.

The name is inspired by "Line", a popular text messenger in Japan and South Korea. It's a combination of Line and the first letter of my name.
